                            You are a pirate captain in the year 1700, you have a population of pirates under
                            your control.
                            
                            Goal: You must grow your pirate armada over time to one day conquer the seas and fight the
                            final boss.
                            
                            Obstacles: Every year that passes there is a chance that something will happen to your armada,
                            such as: disease, kraken, and storms. Along the way players will deal with losing battles due to
                            facing them prematurely, varying prices and values of commodities, as well as fluctuating fish
                            and treasure yields.
                            
                            Rules:
                            ● At any point of the game you may challenge the final boss, if you lose you must restart. If
                            you win you will become the pirate lord and you will be compared against other pirate
                            legends via leaderboards.

                            ● You may also challenge the royal navy at any time with your total pirate armada, with
                            each battle getting progressively harder, if you win you gain the spoils of the battle such
                            as: captured navy men, fish, and doubloons, if you lose you lose varying amounts of
                            pirates, boats, cannons and fish.

                            ● At the start of the game you begin with 5 boats with 5 cannons on each, 50 pirates, 150
                            fish, and 25 doubloons.

                            ● You may click a button to advance one year in which you must feed your pirates fish to
                            keep them alive, if you malnourished them, some or many may die. Each pirate requires 5
                            fish annually to survive, a random amount of pirates will join your armada each year.

                            ● Pirates can be assigned to go fishing(1 pirate yields 1-3 fish annually), go treasure
                            hunting(5 pirates minimum and yields 5-10 doubloons annually),build boats(10 pirates
                            minimum and yields 1 boat annually)

                            ● Each boat is allowed 5 cannons and 10 pirates maximum for battles. The more cannons
                            you have, the more damage you will do during battles leading to an increased chance of
                            victory.

                            ● There is a market in which you can buy and sell boats, cannons, and fish, prices and
                            values will slightly vary randomly each year.

                            ● If more than 50% of your pirates die from starvation, you may be thrown overboard and
                            forced to restart.
